# Machine-Learning

An intro to understanding basic machine learning algorithms. Datasets are from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).

Linear Regression 
> Contains an implementation of Linear regression algorithm, with and without regularization parameter. Model selection and tuning the log lamda for the best Model. Using validation data and regularization to prevent overfitting the data.

Perceptron
> Contains an implementation of the basic perceptron algorithm and kernel perceptron algorithm. Uses [svm-light](http://svmlight.joachims.org/) on the UCI digit dataset and compares it with the perceptron algorithms.

Feature Selection
> Contains implementation of various feature selection methods like pearsonCorrelation, signal to noise ratio and T-test. Compares  [svm-light](http://svmlight.joachims.org/) and K-nearest neighbour implementation in sci-kit learn, python machine learning framework.
