programming language : octave.

scripts:

prashPlotdataset.m 	-- plots the data in dataset.dat
prashPlottrain.m	-- plots the data in train.dat
prashPlottest.m		-- plots the data in test.dat
prashPlotvalid.m	-- plots the data in valid.dat

prash5d1.m		-- solves the linear regression without regularization using E(w) for model M = [0,9] 
			   and plots the erms for train and test against Model.
prash5d2.m		-- solves the linear regression without regularization and adding the validation set to train,
		 	   using E(w) for model M = [0,9] and plots erms for train+validation and test against Model.
prash5d3.m		-- solves the linear Regression with regularization fixing M = 9 for lg lamda = [-50,0] and plots the values.
prash5d3a.m		-- solves the linear Regression with regularization fixing M =9 and lg lamda = -20 prints erms for train and test
prash5d3b.m		-- solves the linear Regression with regularization fixing M =9 and lg lamda = -20 prints erms for train+validation 				   and test.

usage :

in the octave prompt , type the script name with out the extension.

example: octave> prashPlotdataset
